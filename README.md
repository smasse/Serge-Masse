DS is DC with added functionality for reacting when certain whistles are picked up, such as sending an email to staff when an alert whistle is emitted by dolphins in a sanctuary. The definition of such reactions will be improved in future versions in order to improve autonomous operations by DS; human users will be able to define the reaction process to be performed by DS and the whistles that trigger them (e.g., sequences).
