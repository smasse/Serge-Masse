Only one of my Android apps is distributed on Google Play(TM).

[SM Spectrogram](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sm.app.spectro&hl=en_CA)

These two are now unpublised and can be obtained by sending me a request by email:

**DC Dolphin Communicator**

**DS Dolphin Surface**

DS is DC with added functionality for reacting when certain whistles are picked up, such as sending an email to staff when an alert whistle is emitted by dolphins in a sanctuary. The definition of such reactions will be improved in future versions in order to improve autonomous operations by DS; human users will be able to define the reaction process to be performed by DS and the whistles that trigger them (e.g., sequences).

Since 2023, the source code is proprietary in order to increase safety for cetaceans. I may allow trusted people to clone some projects if requested.
