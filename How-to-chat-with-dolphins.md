These instructions show that chatting with dolphins may be easier than expected, when using specially designed software such as DC Dolphin Communicator or some other application

## Steps:

## 1. Basic Setup:
	
### 1.1. Assume low funding
	
### 1.2. Hardware: inexpensive Android tablet, even second-hand one will work
	
### 1.3. Free software: DC Dolphin Communicator or DS Dolphin Surface or DC2 Dolphin Chat

- Available from Google Play(TM) store.
	
### 1.4. Inexpensive hydrophone and projecting transducer 

- May need a Y-connector to the tablet audio port
- Experiment with waterproof Bluetooth speakers and microphones
	
### 1.5. Inexpensive waterproofing setup 

- Example: robust transparent bag, all hardware inside bag to avoid holes in bag for cables
- Some experimentation needed with the equipment that one finds with one's budget

### 1.6. Optional special waterproof tablet (more expensive)

### 1.7. Test the equipment:

- Test in air: two devices, and one device with self-test mode

- Test with tablet in air with hydrophones (in water)

- Test in water

- Test your initial predefined whistles

	- Many hours of work defining experimental whistles: at the beginning, these artificial whistles are only to trigger responses from participants and better whistles will be designed based on these responses, and this could go on for some years; see Section 3 below.

	- Review whistle recordings from the web

	- DC and DS come with hardcoded examples of whistles

	- Learn about dolphin whistle characteristics and underwater acoustics

	- Learn the ethics of interspecies communication: respect the participants

## 2. Find applicable dolphins

### 2.1. Not Captive

### 2.2. Legal Issues

- Ensure that you are aware of all legal issues in your specific situation; you may need to consult legal experts; a friendly and experienced academic may help you get started with these.

- I cannot help with legal issues

### 2.3. Budget Issues

- Could be difficult to get funding, one may need to self-fund
- Some current projects may help, e.g., Project CETI and Earth Species Project.

### 2.4. Easiest Species to Start With:

- Tursiop truncatus, or close relative
- Stenella frontalis, or close relative

### 2.5. Possible Locations: 

- Near shore, small boat, examples:
	- The Bahamas
	- Middle East
	- South-East Asia
	- Africa

- From shore, examples:	
	- Sanctuary for dolphins that were captive performers
	- Western Australia (requires local support)

- Commercial whale watching operator (refuse unethical ones)
		
- No captivity, except possibly extraordinarily good facilities, for mental enrichment

### 2.6. Known Friendly Dolphins 

- There are a few individual dolphins around the world that are known to interact with people at sea

### 2.7. Stranding events: 

- Often catastrophic, very traumatic, some whistle interactions could be helpful for animals e.g., to reduce stress; **not recommended** except with participation of experienced people

## 3. Conduct communication experiments, multiple repeats per session
	
### 3.1. Devise a visual process to go with your initial whistles in order to help convey your meaning

- For example, by associating some whistle with an object or with some human actions, with or without a prop

### 3.2. Try to understand the replies from the dolphin(s)

- You could try to replay some whistles received from the dolphin(s) and observe carefully the reaction (these reaction can be fast and fleeting)

### 3.4. Try different schemes based on your hunches, in a fast pace

- For example, a whistle with 3 or 4 fast variations (e.g., wv) has shown to create some impressions for some toothed cetaceans, but such special whistles must not be overused

- Keep interacting with new whistles and few repetitions in order to keep the dolphins interested, as many seem to get bored or disinterested quite easily

- Your fast pace is probably considered very slow for dolphins

### 3.5. Document each attempts for later review and for sharing

- DC and DS have functions to keep the session data in an external database

## 4. Pause: Review results and determine next step
- could be to add features to the software (could take a few months)
- could be to improve the hardware setup
- could be to get more funding
- could be to redesign the experimental model
- could be to rethink out of the box
- could be to share results and prepare next experimental session period
