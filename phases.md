## Probable phases of communication with dolphins - DRAFT - June 2024
Serge Masse

### 1. development of first sessions designs with artificial whistles lexicon
  - may require some failed experimentation with free dolphins

### 2. first successful sessions
  - dolphins are trying to adapt to app limitations and h-user slowness in figuring out what dolphins are trying to say/do;
  - I am confident that if the human team does a good job with the dolphins then they the dolphins will try hard to adapt and try to have human learn (for example, they will slow down their reactions);
  - the main difficulty to overcome will be the human user slowness in understanding dolphins reaction;
  - the main cause of this is the great difficulties for people to accept the high intelligence of dolphins, most people cannot overcome this deep bias against animal intelligence

### 3. sessions are producing effective observations from dolphins reactions
  - much review work needed to figure things out and to define priority improvements to the app and sessions designs

### 4. pause for additional funding and app improvements
  - if enough data is available at this point, an ML model may be built (or customized) and included in the app in order to help interpret dolphin reactions in real time

### 5. new app may help in interpreting more complex emissions from dolphins 
  - this may require multiple cycles and much technical and understanding improvements
  - this is just the beginning of understanding a small subset of dolphin communications

### 6. after many years of using human defined whistles, eventually we will learn some of the natural whistles and other vocalisations
  - it will be even more years before we can fully understand one dolphin species or a few dolphin species communication, as this is somewhat different from one species to another
  - it will be very challenging technically to develop tools for this research; dolphins often emit whistles over one another, sometimes 5 overlapping whistles, for some minutes, and they emit clicks at the same time as whistles 
  - one of the main applications may be the support of emergency health care for dolphins as this seems to be one area where we humans may have an advantage (e.g., our antibiotics do work well for dolphins)
