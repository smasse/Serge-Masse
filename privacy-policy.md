For all my applications currently published, I do not sell any usage data, or any other kind of data.

The data processed by my apps are private and owned by the user.

The apps contain no ads, no tracking by the apps.

My apps are currently distributed on the Google Play(TM) store, and this does involve some tracking by Google, but there is no added tracking in my apps. 

For some apps, not for Spectro, autonomous emails are sent via a gmail account that I manage, and these emails, which are written by my apps, are visible by me. The destination of these emails are defined by the user.

Manual emails sent by the user of my apps are not visible by me. Such manual emails are usually triggered by the user when using a button in a text window to send the text content via the email service chosen by the user.
